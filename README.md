##  Project Overview

Mondrian's paintings are composed of grids and primary colors, which makes them a perfect way to practice **CSS Grid Layout**. This project helped me understand how to divide a layout into rows and columns, and how to place elements precisely using grid properties.

- Defining `grid-template-rows` and `grid-template-columns`
- Using `grid-row` and `grid-column` to position elements
- Applying `gap` between grid items
- Styling individual boxes with background colors and borders
- How modern layout tools like CSS Grid make complex designs easier

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
